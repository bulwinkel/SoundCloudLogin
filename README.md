SoundCloud Login Demo
=====================

This project demonstrates the first stage of the SoundCloud OAuth2 process on Android
for login with Email, Facebook and Google+.
 
It has no 3rd party dependencies (except the support library) and works on Android 4.1 and up.

I have included a client ID and callback scheme so you can run the application without having 
to setup a project on SoundCloud. DO NOT use these credentials in production.

All the goods are in the `SoundCloudLoginActivity` class. I have left comments throughout
explaining why things are done as they are.

If you want to see it in action, check out the [wonder.fm](http://wonder.fm/) [android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hydricmedia.wonderfm&hl=en).
